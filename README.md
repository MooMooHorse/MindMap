# README
This project is not a shared project yet is public for personal reason.
So this intro doc might be hard for you to understand but that's fine since you're not the target audience for this project.

The target audience for this project is MaYuzhe's Team and the ones who're(s) actually completing the code.

Here's my current plan.

## Improve user experience

The top mission now considering the time stress and the willingness for actual programmer(s) of coding, is improving user experience, which can be shown in following aspects:

### Size of the textbox

If the size of the textbox is fixed, then it can have a huge possiblity of having textboxes overlapped with each other.

This is not ideal.

The solution to this is either let user drag textbox by mouse, or using `button to control`.

To *save time*, I'm sticking to the `latter approach`.

### Withdraw

This can solve both targets :
* escape line
* come back to history version

This is quite necessary, but with barriers.

To make it *easier*, we will **NOT** recover the `change model` operation.

---

In the first modified version, Import will not be supported for these functions. 

The importance of having `Withdraw` for import is **LARGE**

Let's get to work.
